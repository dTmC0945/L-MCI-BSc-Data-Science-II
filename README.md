# A Gentle Introduction

Welcome to the lecture materials for use in **B.Sc - Data Science and
Machine Learning II** where our focus will be on the topics of:

1.  The types of ML techniques used in industry,
2.  What methods are available to use for which situation,
3.  Understading the current programming libraries for ML & AI,
4.  A Detailed introduction to the world of Neural Networks.

## Lecture Information

The details of the lecture are given below.

| DESCRIPTION   | VALUE                                       |

### Assignments

There will be one (**1**) assignment and (**1**) exam for this course.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION            | GRADE (%) |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Individual Assignment | 40        |
| Final Examination     | 60        |
| Sum                   | 100       |

### Individual Assignment

An individual assignment will be given to you to work on. This
assignment will consist of questions pertaining to concepts of Machine
Learning and how to implement them on Python.

**NOTE:** The assignment is individual and is not meant to be worked as
a group. Once the code and the work is submitted it will be vetted
against a software to determine if any collusion has occured.

### Final Examination

The Final exam will be done on the last session where questions covering
the entire lecture will be asked. The duration of the exam will be
ninety (**90**) and will be done written.

You are able to bring a calculator to the exam but no personal reference
sheets are allowed. Any reference documents (if needed) will be provided
for you during the beginning of the exam.

## The Lecture Structure

As it currently is, the lecture covers topic on the overview on ML with
a heavy emphasis of **programming first**. The lecture approaches ML
with emphasis on coding the problem and observing effect and then
understanding the reasoning behind it.

The structure of the lecture is shown below.

| TOPIC | DESCRIPTION | SESSION |
|----|----|----|
| The Machine Learning Landscape | A Brief Overview on the landscape of ML along with its categories and major topics | 1 |
| End to End ML Project | An example application of a ML project without getting drowned in detail. | 2 |
| Classification | An introduction into different types of classification used in ML | 3 |
| Training Models | An overview of different types of Regression modelling and Gradient descents methods. | 4 |
| Support Vector Machines | Supervised max-margin models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. | 5 |
| Desicion Trees | A look into the decision support hierarchical model that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, | 5 |
| Ensemble Learning and Random Forests | An overview of an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time | 5 |
| Dimensionality Reduction | A brief overview on Dimensionality Reduction, a method for representing a given dataset using a lower number of features (i.e. dimensions) while still capturing the original data's meaningful properties. | 6 |
| Unsupervised Learning Techniques | Focus on the methods used for clustering such as k-means, gaussian mixture and other methods | 6 |
| Intoruction to Artificial Neural Networks | An introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with examples and execises. | 7 |

## Code Supplement

The Code supplement is a Github webpage dedicated to hosting all the
relevant code used in the lecture as it is not feasible to fit all the
content of the code to the slides and it is easier to share this way.
